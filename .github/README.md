# Git-based Property Manager

This is a simple physical property manager that uses Git for version control and storage. It is designed to be used by a single user or a small team. It is not a full-fledged property management system, but it can be used to manage a small number of assets that have a unique identifier, such as a serial number, asset tag, or other unique and searchable identifier.

It loosely follows the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well", and the KISS principle of "keep it simple, stupid" or "keep it stupid simple".

## Goals

- Simple and intuitive command-line interface
- Simple and intuitive web interface
- Small learning curve
- No database, no server, no cloud dependencies
- Automatically federated and distributed via Git
